The Real-Time Collaborative Drawing Canvas is a web-based application that allows multiple users to draw simultaneously on a shared canvas. It uses HTML5 Canvas for drawing and WebSockets (via Node.js and Socket.io) for real-time communication between connected clients.

Users can draw using various tools such as brush and eraser, select different colors, and adjust stroke widths. Every drawing action is synchronized instantly across all connected users, ensuring a smooth collaborative experience.

The app also includes features like global undo/redo, live user cursor indicators, and user management to display active participants. It demonstrates real-time data handling, event broadcasting, and synchronization between multiple clients in a networked environment.
